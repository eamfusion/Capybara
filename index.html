<p>I am so excited to introduce my beloved Capybara named Phil. Phil means the world to me. You can just see in the picture above just how graceful and wholesome he is. I would give my very life if it meant Phil lived a full, happy life.</p>
<p>Below are some links, if you so wish to get to know my beautiful floofy animal. I know it will be worth all of your time. So please, get to know him like I do.
